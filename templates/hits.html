    <h5>Early CloudFlare's architecture...</h5>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Everything was controlled by a single Postgres database that made
            very heavy use of stored procedures, that called other procedures,
            that called others. It was one giant program inside the database. It
            took me a while to comprehend what he'd done but it was really
            great. The database ran everything and all those functions made sure
            that audit logs were kept, that the calls were allowed for the user
            ID being passed in, and some of these procedures made external calls
            to APIs including getting things like SSL certificates.
        </p>
        <p>It was a magnificent monolith inside a database.</p>
